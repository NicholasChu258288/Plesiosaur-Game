# Plesiosaur-Game

How to Play:
Movement keys are the WASD keys, eat the blue and orange fish to increase score, eating the purple pufferfish will reduce health by one and getting hit by a missile will lose you all your health. Refresh the page to restart the game. You can also play the game using the link: https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/1C7QZ91gDDLsRalz40G_edPDPyJ4ZYxDEfw4l9Sx-hE

Background Info:
A project I created in my AP Computer Science class in high school when participating in the Congressional App Challenge using an IDE found on code.org which uses JavaScript. I creates all the sprites by myself and this was just a beginner project to explore an interest in game design and learn about such things as moanipulating and animating sprites. I have yet to implement a restart screen yet so refresh the page when dead or wanting to restart.
